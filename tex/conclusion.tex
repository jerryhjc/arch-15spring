To alleviate the limitations posed by conventional technologies, designers have recently explored new technologies for designing cache and memory hierarchy. The use of PCM and STT-RAM as a universal choice for main memory presents both challenges and opportunities. It is clear that while non-volatile memory provides a promising alternative to conventional DRAM, it also has several limitations such as large power consumption. To reduce power consumption of NVM we proposed several NVM optimized techniques, including cache replacement policy analysis, Level 3 cache integration, reduction of unnecessary write back, hybrid NVM and DRAM architecture.   


We find that hybrid memory architecture can help to reduce leakage power from DRAM, but it should be careful about its memory scheduler overhead and the complexity of memory scheduler should also increase. we show that although L3 cache integrated in the system increase some kind of power, but it make the system more practical and will add more data buffer to reduce write back operation, which can help to reduce write power of NVM in hybrid memory.
